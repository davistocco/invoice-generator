# Invoice Generator
This repository contains an open-source project that implements an automated invoice generator for the Nota Control system. The program performs login, generates invoices based on specific parameters, and sends them via email. It is a simple and efficient solution to automate the invoice generation process in Nota Control. Visit their website at: [Nota Control](https://www.notacontrol.com.br/home/)<br>

### How to generate

1. Fill in the `options.json` file at the root of the project. Format:

```json
{
    "notaControlCity": "ribeiraopreto",
    "login": "99999999999",
    "password": "999999",
    "baseInvoiceCode": "99",
    "invoiceValue": 2000,
    "invoiceMonth": "Junho",
    "invoiceYear": 2023,
    "emailRecipients": [
        "financial@company.com",
        "whatever@you.com"
    ]
}
```
- "notaControlCity": The city where your access is registered (e.g., ribeiraopreto). This will be concatenated in the notaeletronica URL.
- "login": Your nota control login (CPF).
- "password": The password associated with the account to log in.
- "baseInvoiceCode": The base code for generating invoices (it is an existing note). It serves as a template for each generated invoice, allowing consistent formatting and structure across all invoices. Contains payer information and other relevant details.
- "invoiceValue": The value of the invoice to be generated.
- "invoiceMonth": The month of the invoice to be generated. Please fill in the month using the full name of the month in PT (e.g., Janeiro, Fevereiro, Mar√ßo, etc.)
- "invoiceYear": The year of the invoice to be generated (e.g., 2023)
- "emailRecipients": A list of email addresses to which the invoices will be sent.

To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start`.

These are the required steps to execute the program. Ensure that you fill in the information correctly in the `options.json` file before running the project.
